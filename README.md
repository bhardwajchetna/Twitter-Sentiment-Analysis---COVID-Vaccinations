# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis---COVID-Vaccinations

This Twitter Analysis has been done in two part: 

1. Text Analytics: Text-mining on “Influencer Tweets” to understand what topics are trending on twitter related to Climate Change and Global Warming

2. Sentiment Analytics: Sentiment analysis on “Vaccination Tweets” & “COVID Vaccination Tweets”  to understand general people’s perception towards the vaccination process. 

The highlight & learning of this minor-project was to use Apache Kafka building the data pipelines and the use of ElasticSearch server to store the twitter streams.
